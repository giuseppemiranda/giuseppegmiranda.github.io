#### I'm PhD student studying cognitive neuroscience at UT Dallas. I've been interested in human brain aging and how cognitive functioning can be preserved as we age. Specifically, I'm interested in neuroimaging and how changes in brain structure impact cognition in aging. Outside of lab I  enjoy playing basketball, running, exercising, traveling, painting, watching my Cleveland sports teams, and spending time with friends and family. 


#### I graduated from the University of Dayton with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. Studied memory, vigilance, and aesthetics and music. Applied Neuroscience at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base studying team cognition and synchronicity.
